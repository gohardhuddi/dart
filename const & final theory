if we never want to chamge the value of a veriable we use const and final;
final name ="ali";
const pi=3.14;

different between const and final
final keyword can be set once and it is initialized when accessed. 
in our program when we use the veriable name only when it is initilized and memory is alocated.
if we donot inilize the verialbe name memory will not be allocated.


const is same as final, but it is compile time constant.
it is initilized during compilation.

instance veriable that are within the class cant be const.
at that levelif we use const we have to use static.
