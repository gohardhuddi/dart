if we never want to change the value of a variable we use const and final;
final name ="ali";
const pi=3.14;

different between const and final
final keyword can be set once and it is initialized when accessed. 
in our program when we use the variable name only when it is initialized and memory is allocated.
if we do not initialize the variable name memory will not be allocated.


const is same as final, but it is compile time constant.
it is initialized during compilation.

instance variable that are within the class cant be const.
at that level if we use const we have to use static.
